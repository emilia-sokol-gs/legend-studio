WHAT Add model loader extension for relational mapping generation, no breaking changes as the 
extension is not added to studio yet
WHY Mapping generation feature was made to allow users to merge their M2M mapping chain into 
one relational mapping
HOW consumer won't be able to leverage this change until new endpoint in engine is introduced
